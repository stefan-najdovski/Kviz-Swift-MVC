# What have I learned with this project (Swift Syntax):
- Model, View , Controler Project Organization
- Mutable Functions
- Structs
- Array of Strings
- Functions that Return A value
```Swift
struct NameOfStruct{
//Construtctor?
init(){
 }
}

func someFuncThatReturnsFloat() -> Float{
 //explicit literal conversion, not sure if I need the Float() better be safe than sorry
 return Float(3.1415)
}


```
